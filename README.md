Emphase is a per panel solar generation solution - via the use of roof based microinverters.  This plugin monitors each panels output, and reports all useful data from the solar Enphase system via the Envoy-S. 
See:[url]http://www.enphase.com[/url]

For a international map of their thousands of installs see.   (last count I see 540,000 installations.... :P )  (gotta be some Indigo users out there ???)

This Plugin connects the the local Enphase [i]Envoy-S[/i] device and pulls all information; including individual panel output (regardless of whether you have that option with your install)

It connects locally to the envoy device - and does not use the enlighten / web-service API.  The local connection provides much more information, is more UpToDate and can be pulled every few minutes without problem.  Having compared the two over some time there is no comparison to this minute-minute data.

Install Plugin - from Github as above.  
(once installed can update from within Plugin)

I recommend you Create a New Folder for devices.  Whilst you might only have one device - the Enphase Envoy-S: If you choose to use panel monitoring (and there is no reason not to - individual panel devices will be created in that folder)

Create "Enphase - Envoy-S Device"
(the Panel devices must be generated by the plugin if needed)

Enter your IP address for you local Envoy (ideally will need static IP)

Enter your Envoy Serial Number (located on web page as seen below:)

Save.

The Plugin has a number of Custom states - showing current production, consumption, and net power (negative indicating exporting power).  
(amongst others)

Device states change from importing to exporting for triggering activity/control pages.

If that's all you want/need - leave it at that. :lol: 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But:
If you want Per Panel data (and no negative) - go back into the Envoy-S device & enable per Panel data and click the newly appeared generate panels button.
(if change mind - this button will change to delete after checkbox unticked - beware though - if you re-generate panels a while later the Plugin will create a whole lot of new Devices which will mean Control Panels etc will need to be redone)

This will generate a PanelDevice for each Panel you have installed.

This shows current Panel output and any status reports and custom states as you can see.
